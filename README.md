# React Website Project

Built a fully responsive React website from scratch, using React Hooks and React Router. This project is aimed at beginner React developers and showcases how to structure and build a multi-component website.

---

## Overview

This React project is a responsive website built with:
- **React Hooks** for managing state and lifecycle events.
- **React Router** for seamless navigation across pages.

### Features
- Responsive design for all devices.
- Clean and modular component-based architecture.
- Includes a homepage, cards section, and a footer.
- Used React best practices to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Challenges Faced

### CSS Organization and Styling
My main difficulty was working with CSS, particularly with properties like `align-items` and `display`. To overcome this, I adopted a method of adding temporary background colors (e.g., red) to elements while working on their layout. This technique helped me visualize the structure and alignment more effectively.

### Image Importing
Another challenge was importing images for the card components. I initially faced a bug that prevented dynamic imports. To resolve this, I defined constants for each image path and imported them one by one, as the project doesnâ€™t include a large number of images.
